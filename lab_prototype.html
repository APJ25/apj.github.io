                <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-4">The smaller cores such as EE25/19, EE30, EE35, and EE40 suffer greater losses and are at risk of thermal runaway. Since the bigger cores provide a better safety margin, the EE55 core provides the best range in safety and has a reduced number of turns for both cases of operation. The EE42 comes closer to these considerations. EE60 has higher optimal losses, ruling out its use, same as for EE50 compared to EE42 and EE55. The study of these two cores can be done practically to select the best core among them.</p>
                <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-4">The core material is chosen to be 3C92. The number of turns for the EE42 primary is 16 on one side, and for the EE55 primary, it is 14. Since the number of turns is low, only one layer is required for both cases.</p>

                <h3 class="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-800 mt-8 mb-4">Transformer Construction and Assembly</h3>
                <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-4">The transformers were constructed for both EE42 and EE55 following the design techniques outlined. The Litz wire was made by twisting two parallel AWG 25 wires for the primary and three parallel AWG 25 wires for the secondary side. The secondary side is kept at 5 turns for both cores.</p>
                <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-4">The outside leg coil formers were made with Design Spark, a 3D modeling tool. The coil former has a thickness of 1mm to ensure uniformity. Each coil former was manually wound with a single layer. The 3D printed coil formers were mounted directly onto the core without any clamps; the fit mainly depends on friction.</p>

                <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-4">The primary coils were twisted in a clockwise manner on the coil formers. The secondary side is coupled in clockwise and anti-clockwise directions. The primary sides were not joined together but left open, with one winding on each side, due to switching requirements. The primary was wound first, with proper insulation using polyester R31 tape, which has a dielectric strength of 5000 V. The insulation tape was also used to bind the cores together to prevent any air gap. The continuity of the windings was checked before the testing stage.</p>

The inductor is made up of three parallel-connected AWG 25 wires with ten turns coiled on the center limb. The air gap is created by sandwiching insulation between the two EE sections, and the overall air gap is checked. R31 polyester tape is used as insulation. The insulating tape is used to bind the two core components together. Prior to testing, the wires’ continuity was examined.</p>

                <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-4">The Mosfets must handle a maximum input voltage stress of 160 V. The maximum output current of the filter inductor is 7.2 A, and the Mosfet must handle a current of 7.2 A. Even though this is the case, better options in terms of reverse recovery time and lower gate charges were required for better ZVS operation. The SiC Mosfet C3M0065090D was chosen.</p>
                <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-4">The diodes in the secondary side have to handle a voltage of up to 24 V. The full-wave rectifier circuit presents a voltage stress of 2Vin/K, which is 53.33 V. For protection from voltage spikes and oscillations, twice the voltage is taken as the voltage rating. The Schottky diode STPS30100ST with a forward voltage drop of 0.65 V and 100 V, 30 A ratings was selected.</p>
                <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-4">The filter capacitance value was calculated, but the value was taken to be much higher, around 100μF, since the system is working in an open loop. 100μF 50V Aluminium electrolytic capacitors were selected.</p>
                <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-4">The Mosfets were first placed on the heat sink by drilling holes and screwing them on. The heat sinks were isolated from each other so that the drains of the Mosfets will not be shorted together. Polyester R31 was used for this purpose. The Mosfets were then soldered onto the board. The gate signals are provided by the TI Delphino launchpad F28379D with appropriate phase shift control. A 12 V input was provided for the isolated gate driver UCC2140A with the corresponding output side voltage of 10 V also applied. The device was tested for the presence of gate signals.</p>
